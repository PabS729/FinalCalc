# Pre-work - *FinalCalc*

**FinalCalc** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Minjing Shi**

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [*] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [*] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [*] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

-A Light/dark theme for the settings screen
-An improved user interface with a delete button for users to cancel their input entirely

## Notes

I find it hard to pass the values changed in settings to the main screen (e.g. background color).
Also it is hard to get over with the logistics surrounding default values, such as saving and loading them.
